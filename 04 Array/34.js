//  34. Linear equation is calculated as follows: ax + by + c = 0. Write a function which calculates value of a linear equation, solveLinEquation.

/* first calculate delta (delta(D)=b*b -4*a*c)
if delta > 0 roots are real and unequal , root1= (-b + Math.sqrt(delta))/2*a and root2 = (-b - Math.sqrt(delta))/2*a
if delta = 0, roots are real and equal, root1 = root2 = -b/2a
if delta < 0 roots are imaginary , root1= (-b +i* Math.sqrt(delta))/2*a and root2 = (-b - i*Math.sqrt(delta))/2*a */
